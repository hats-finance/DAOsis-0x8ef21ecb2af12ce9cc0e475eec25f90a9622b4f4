# **DAOsis Audit Competition on Hats.finance** 


## Introduction to Hats.finance


Hats.finance builds autonomous security infrastructure for integration with major DeFi protocols to secure users' assets. 
It aims to be the decentralized choice for Web3 security, offering proactive security mechanisms like decentralized audit competitions and bug bounties. 
The protocol facilitates audit competitions to quickly secure smart contracts by having auditors compete, thereby reducing auditing costs and accelerating submissions. 
This aligns with their mission of fostering a robust, secure, and scalable Web3 ecosystem through decentralized security solutions​.

## About Hats Audit Competition


Hats Audit Competitions offer a unique and decentralized approach to enhancing the security of web3 projects. Leveraging the large collective expertise of hundreds of skilled auditors, these competitions foster a proactive bug hunting environment to fortify projects before their launch. Unlike traditional security assessments, Hats Audit Competitions operate on a time-based and results-driven model, ensuring that only successful auditors are rewarded for their contributions. This pay-for-results ethos not only allocates budgets more efficiently by paying exclusively for identified vulnerabilities but also retains funds if no issues are discovered. With a streamlined evaluation process, Hats prioritizes quality over quantity by rewarding the first submitter of a vulnerability, thus eliminating duplicate efforts and attracting top talent in web3 auditing. The process embodies Hats Finance's commitment to reducing fees, maintaining project control, and promoting high-quality security assessments, setting a new standard for decentralized security in the web3 space​​.

## Scope of Audit

Scope of the Audit

The audit will focus on ensuring the security, functionality, and efficiency of the following components of the Daosis platform:
 1. DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization):
 • Smart contracts governing the decision-making and voting mechanisms within the DAO.
 • Governance token functionality, including staking, voting, and rewards distribution.
 • Protection against vulnerabilities such as unauthorized access, voting manipulation, or denial-of-service attacks.

***MOST IMPORTANT (points 2 & 3)***
 2. IDOs (Initial DEX Offerings):
 • Smart contracts enabling users to create and manage their IDOs.
 • Validation and security of the process that allows users to launch and participants to fill IDOs.
 • Handling of raised funds to ensure correct allocation (45% of the token goes to DEX LP, 55% sold in the IDO & 100% of raised funds are used for LP) and prevention of exploits such as rug pulls or fund mismanagement.

 3. Token Listing Mechanism on Neby (DEX):
 • Automatic listing of tokens once the IDO is successfully filled.
 • Security of the fund transfer process to Neby (DEX).
 • Verification of proper liquidity pool creation, with raised funds securely locked in the DEX.

 4. Launchpad:
 • User-facing interfaces and their interaction with backend smart contracts.
 • Validation of workflows from token minting to IDO creation and final listing.
 • Handling of edge cases, such as failed IDOs or unexpected user actions.

The audit will focus on identifying vulnerabilities, ensuring adherence to best practices in blockchain development, and verifying proper integration between all components to provide a secure and efficient platform.



## Conclusion

The audit report on the DAOsis Audit Competition hosted on Hats.finance highlights a comprehensive security evaluation aimed at fortifying the Daosis platform ahead of its launch. Hats.finance distinguishes itself through decentralized audit competitions which leverage the skills of numerous auditors to proactively detect and resolve potential issues in Web3 projects. The DAOsis competition, running for two weeks and offering a maximum reward of $11,683.47, saw 134 submissions with payouts distributed among 40 participants, emphasizing a result-driven approach where only successful vulnerability discoveries are compensated. This ensures efficient budget allocation and draws top auditing talent. The audit's scope concentrated on key components of the DAOsis platform, namely the DAO governance systems, IDO processes, and token listing mechanisms on Neby (DEX). The goal was to detect and mitigate vulnerabilities, ensure seamless integration between components, and confirm compliance with best blockchain practices. Such meticulous scrutiny underscores Hats.finance's dedication to establishing new standards in decentralized security for the Web3 space.
